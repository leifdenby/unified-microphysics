Preliminary spec:

- new microphysics implementations are added by creating a file in the format
  `mphys_{module_name}.f90`, which is expected to a have subroutine `init`.

# TODO

- check that the mphys routine has the necessary components
- move tests to separate directory
- allow setting of physical constants of hydrometeors by host model, so that the use of the same constants can be gauranteed

# Ideas

- instead of labelling state vector components could instead simply point to
  variables already defined, with names that we recognise
